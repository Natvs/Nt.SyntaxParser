# GrammarParser

## Introduction
This project takes a grammar file as input and parses it to an abstract tree.
It aims to be used when creating new software languages.

## Grammar file
Parsing the grammar file occurs in two steps. The grammar file is first parsed to process pre-parsing lines.
The resulting file is then parsed into the final grammar file that would be parsed into a grammar structure.

### Defining symbols used in the grammar
You need to provide the grammar with a list of the symbol used before using them.
These symbols are divided into terminals (constant strings) and non terminals (symbols to derive).

Terminals and non terminals are both listed into a list of the form `{symbol1, symbol2, ...}`. What changes however is the start of the line.

To define terminals, use:
```
T = {terminal1, terminal2, ...}
```
To define non terminals, use:
```
N = {nonterminal1, nonterminal2, ...}
```

Note that symbols can contain any lower or upper letter, or symbols except ':' ',' '=' '{' '}' ';' '-' '>' '+' or '*'.
If you wish to include one of these symbols into your grammar, it must not be surrounded by any other symbol. For example, `}` is allowed, but not `a}` or `}b`.

### Setting grammar rules
You need to provide each non-terminal at least one derivation rule. The derivation can be any sequence of previously defined symbols.

These rules have the following syntax:
```
R: non-terminal -> symbol1 symbol2 symbol3 ... ;
```

You can define multiple derivations for a same non-terminal with the syntax:
```
R: non-terminal -> symbol11 symbol12 ... | symbol21 symbol22 ...
```

You need to separate all your symbols by at least one white space. White spaces you write are ignored when parsing. 
If you wish to include a white space as a symbol, you can use the escape symbol `\ `.

The symbol `;` is used to mark the end of the rule. If you want to include this character as a symbol, you can use the escape character `\;`.

> Note that the arrow `->` can be as long as you want. It must begin with `-` and ends with a `>`. So `---->` also works.

### Escape characters
In a general way, when writing a derivation of a rule, you can use an escape character to ensure its interpretation as a character.
It is useful if the character you wish to include in your derivation has a meaning for parsing the grammar.

Examples:

1. The previous section already describes use cases of `\ ` and `\;`.

2. For special characters like ':' ',' '=' '{' '}' ';' '-' '>' '+' or '*', writing it in a symbol will automatically create a new word when reading the symbol at parsing time.
If you want a symbol to contain one of these characters, you can introduce it with the escape character.

3. The character `\` alone will only ensure the following character is interpreted as a character. If you want to add it in a derivation, you can use `\\`.

### Defining regular expressions
Alternatively, you define a derivation for non-terminal as a regular expression.
Regular expressions can always be described by a grammar. However it is sometimes a hassle to set terminals, non-terminals and many rules that can make your code less manageable.
You can use regular expressions without having to previously define the symbols used in it and define it all in just one rule. The syntax is a follow:

```
E: non-terminal = regex ;
```

As for rules, you can use any escape character, like `\;` as ';' marks the end of the regular expression.

### Setting grammar first symbol
The grammar needs a symbol to begin with for syntaxically defining if a string belongs to the grammar language. This symbol is called axiom and is defined with the syntax:
```
A = axiom
```
The axiom can be any non-terminal, but only one of those.

### Pre-parsing instructions
There are two pre-parsing instructions. Both the upper and lower case versions of these instructions are accepted.

| Instruction | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
|addtopath|Adds a folder to the import path|ADDTOPATH ../grammars|
|import|Imports the content of an external grammar file|IMPORT grammar.txt|

For example, if you have a grammar file under "../grammars/grammar.txt", then there are two ways of importing it.
```
IMPORT ../grammars/grammar.txt
```
or
```
ADDTOPATH ../grammars
IMPORT grammar.txt
```

### Example of grammar file use case
Consider the following grammar files.

File `const.txt`
```
N = {CONST, STRING, INT, FLOAT}

R: CONST -> STRING | INT | FLOAT ;

E: STRING = [abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ]* ;
E: INT = ( 0 | [0123456789]* ) ;
E: FLOAT = [0123456789]+ ( ,[0123456789]+ )? ;
```

File `params.txt`
```
N = {PARAMS, TYPE, STRING}
T = {;, ,}

R: PARAMS -> TYPE STRING \;
		   | TYPE STRING , PARAMS \; ;

E: TYPE = (int|double|char|string) ;
```

These files can't be directly used as grammars as they don't define any axiom. In params, the symbol `STRING` that is used is not even defined.
Where these files could be of interest, is when imported into other big files.

```body.txt
IMPORT const.txt
IMPORT params.txt

T = {(, ), {, }, ;, =}
N = {BODY, TYPE, STRING, CONST}
S = BODY
R: BODY -> TYPE STRING \;
		 | TYPE STRING = CONST \;
		 | TYPE STRING ( ) { BODY } \;
		 | TYPE STRING ( PARAMS ) { BODY } \; ;
```

After pre-parsing, the grammar becomes something like
```
T = {;, ,, (, ), {, }, =}
N = {CONST, STRING, INT, FLOAT, PARAMS, TYPE, BODY}

S = BODY

R: CONST -> STRING | INT | FLOAT ;
R: PARAMS -> TYPE STRING \;
		   | TYPE STRING , PARAMS \; ;
R: BODY -> TYPE STRING \;
		 | TYPE STRING = CONST \;
		 | TYPE STRING ( ) { BODY } \;
		 | TYPE STRING ( PARAMS ) { BODY } \; ;

E: STRING = [abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ]* ;
E: INT = ( 0 | [0123456789]* ) ;
E: FLOAT = [0123456789]+ ( ,[0123456789]+ )? ;
E: TYPE = (int|double|char|string) ;
```

Note that pre-parsing instructions does not works recursively, meaning you can import files only from you main grammar file.
